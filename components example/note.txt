    Are the component reference types of the same type?
    It looks like Vue components are statically referenced, as opposed to Vugu, where components are dynamically referenced.
    Could this affect the performance metrics of the comparison?

    Before implementing this in the thesis, this should be fixed.
    DOM interactions are still equal.
