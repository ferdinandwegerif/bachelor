    Vue contains a Component for each tower, Vugu does not. Will this affect performance testing?
    Ideally performance testing for the frameworks should use the same algorithm as well, currently they do not.

    Before implementing this in the thesis, this should be fixed.
    DOM interactions are still equal.
